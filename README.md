# Milestone Project 1 - 3 Calaveras Brew Co.

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly based on our craft brewery. We want to convey the same passion with which we produce our beers as well as the experience that our clients have when they visit us.
We try to be unique and different with the rest of our "competitors". As part of our success, we want to stay with simple and unique services.
Like our beers ... That is the spirit that we want to convey with our website.

## Overview

Our passion is our beers and we want to share it with everyone. The objective of 3 Calaveras Brew Co. (3CBCo) is to create a platform where the user can learn about our beers, our food, our brewery in Limerick and our services. We want a simple, dynamic and easy-to-use platform to attract the user to know us and enjoy our beers.

## Technologies Used

#### Languages:


#### Libraries:


#### Version Control:

- [Github](https://github.com/) - Used to store the code and use of Github Pages to deploy the website. 
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) - Used as the primary version control IDE for development to further push and commit code to Gihub.

#### Other:

- [Code Institute Course Content](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/) - Primary source of learning code.
- [ChromeDevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - Used frequently to detect any issues/bugs or layout differences.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - used as a general resource for CSS and coding tips.
- [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - used as a general resource for layout tips or questions.
- [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - Used to check how the layout of the website looks across different devices- found at the top of this "NEED TO BE UPDATED". 
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) - Used to test website layout on multiple devices.
- [Google Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) - Used to test all pages on a mobile device
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - Used for help in adding carousel structure.
- [CSS Formatter](https://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/) - Used to beautify CSS code.

## Testing

- Forms testing: to ensure the website was functioning as it should, I tested each of the forms on different devices and browsers. This was done by clicking the send button on the Contact Us, Sign Up, Book Now and Buy !!!  modal without any text in inputs to make sure it resulted with the desired response of 'Please fill out this field'.
- Links (Internal & External): Each of the links when clicked have been checked so that the user is directed to the desired location. To better enhance UX, I made sure each link has either a colour change or underline when hovered (with exception of the navbar brand) and included a target attribute so that a new browser window is opened. 
- Testing across various devices: I used BrowserStack for this, in addition to feedback from my friends and peers. The devices on which the website was tested are as follows:

## Project Bugs and Solutions


--------
## Deployment

- Once a GIthub account was created, I opened a new repository by clicking the green button "new". To create this project, I used the Code Institute's student [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Click on the green "gitpod" button where one is redirected to to [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
- Gitpod, a cloud-based version control software or IDE was used to write all code for this project.
- It was then pushed or saved in the terminal to Github where it is stored in a [repository](https://github.com/ajba1973/ms1-3cbco/)
- Under "Settings", I scrolled down to Github Pages and selected "Master Branch" under source, to where the page was automated.
- Once this was selected, the project was pushed to Github pages and the URL is then displayed
- To access the code, it can be run locally by either selecting "clone" which provides an URL one can use on their local machine or "download" which is where one can download the zip file on to their machine.
