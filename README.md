## UX  


## Strategy

Our brewery website is aimed at the general public with the legal age for alcohol consumption, families are welcome ( for future  updates we serve meals , special menu for children). As per Covid restrictions our Tap room and the guided tour are close so we implented a shop online for our beers and provide a book system for our guided tours.

--------

- To provide a professional, clear and easy to navigate website for any customer, be it
first time user as well

- Establish an online presence with the end result as appearing as one craft breweries that can sell beers directly to any costumer from Ireland, Uk or Europe.

- to easily navigate throught the contents.
- to find detailed information about the desired product.
- to be able to contact with the businees.


#### As a Regular User: 

--------
## Scope

This website incorporates a MVP (Minimal Viable Product) method for te next reasons:

- Creates a clear and practical website without overloading the user.
- Explain to the user about the nature of the business.
- Include relevant and inspiring images and product offers.
- Satisfies the general needs from the user and the owners of the business, contact information, products and forms, etc.

--------
## Structure

The website meets the following three pillars be consistent, intuitive and easy to learn.
- Consistency:  interface elements offers subtle visual feedback to the user (on hovering, focusing and pressing buttons and fields) that is similar across
the application and helps the user to quickly learn the functionality.
- Intuitive:  the interface interacts with user actions according to user expectations.

--------
## Skeleton

The website is divided into the four sections and although the wireframes do not exactly match my final project.  
I added further enhancements by implementing further imagery, add the carousel feature on the tour page and creating modal Contact Us!, Sign up, Buy!! and Book Now forms instead the create another pages.

## Surface

### Colours

- I wanted to use colors associated with the breweries and the raw materials we use (malt, hops and yeast) but also add our personal touch. Brown, dark green, gold and sky blue colors. In addition to using relevant images to start the user in weighing in having a beer.
- The main color is a Faux-Dark Green, #05281d. [Faux-DarkGreen](http://www.2020colours.com/05281d)  I pick this color for the next attributes tranquility, personal growth, healing and the home. So for me the brewery I thinking as my second home.

### Typography

- I used Google Fonts to explore different fonts I could use with my website and decided on "Kufam" and "Cursive" as the back-up font. I chose this type of font because I wanted to customize our page with something different. But also that it served as a connection with the exotic.
  This font is Arabic-Latin bilingual typeface that are based on 7th century inscriptions.
- [Kufam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kufam#standard-styles)

### Icons

- Font Awesome was the go-to for icons used and they can be seen across all pages such as the navbar-brand, list items, offers cards and social links.

### Images

- Each of the images was carefully selected to represent the scene and the desire to visit, to know, to learn and to enjoy a craft beer.
- All images are sized and compressed for the best UX flow.

## Testing

- Forms testing: to ensure the website was functioning as it should, I tested each of the forms on different devices and browsers. This was done by clicking the send button on the Contact Us, Sign Up, Book Now and Buy !!!  modal without any text in inputs to make sure it resulted with the desired response of 'Please fill out this field'.
- Links (Internal & External): Each of the links when clicked have been checked so that the user is directed to the desired location. To better enhance UX, I made sure each link has either a colour change or underline when hovered (with exception of the navbar brand) and included a target attribute so that a new browser window is opened. 
- Testing across various devices: I used BrowserStack for this, in addition to feedback from my friends and peers. The devices on which the website was tested are as follows:

## Project Bugs and Solutions


--------
## Deployment

- Once a GIthub account was created, I opened a new repository by clicking the green button "new". To create this project, I used the Code Institute's student [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Click on the green "gitpod" button where one is redirected to to [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
- Gitpod, a cloud-based version control software or IDE was used to write all code for this project.
- It was then pushed or saved in the terminal to Github where it is stored in a [repository](https://github.com/ajba1973/ms1-3cbco/)
- Under "Settings", I scrolled down to Github Pages and selected "Master Branch" under source, to where the page was automated.
- Once this was selected, the project was pushed to Github pages and the URL is then displayed
- To access the code, it can be run locally by either selecting "clone" which provides an URL one can use on their local machine or "download" which is where one can download the zip file on to their machine.
